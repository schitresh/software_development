## Arithmetic Operators
```py
# Includes regular operators like +, -, *, /
a / b # Float Division: 5 / 2 = 2.5
a // b # Floor Division: 5 / 2 = 2
a % b # Modulus
a ** b # Exponent
```

## Logical Operators
```py
a and b # Same as && in other languages
a or b # Same as || in other languages
not a
```

## Membership Operators
```py
a = 10
b = [10, 20]

a in b # True
a in { 10: 'ten' } # True
a not in b # False
```

## Identity Operators
```py
a = [10, 20]
b = [10, 20]
c = a

a is c # True
a is not b # True
```

## Other Operators
- Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

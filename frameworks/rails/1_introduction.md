## Introduction
- Web application development framework written in ruby programming language
  - Designed to program web applications easily by making basic assumptions
  - Allows to write less code while accomplishing more
- It is opionionated software
  - Makes assumption that there is a best way to do things
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  - Every piece of knowledge must have a
    - Single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system
  - By not writing the same information over and over again
    - Code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy
- Convention Over Configuration
  - Rails has opinions and defaults to this set of conventions
  - Rather tahn require that you specify minutiae endless config files
- To create a new application called blog, run `rails new blog`
  - this will also install gem dependencies already mentioned in Gemfile

## Structure
- app/
  - Controllers, models, views, helpers, mailerss, channels, jobs, assets
- bin/
  - Rails scripts to start, set up, update, deploy, run application
- config/
  - Configuration for routes, database, etc.
- db/
  - Current database schema and migrations
- lib/
  - Extended modules for application
- log/
- public/
  - Static files & complied assets, exposed as is when app is running
- storage/
  - Active storage file for disk service
- test/
  - Unit tests, fixtures, etc.
- tmp/
  - Temporary files like cache, pid files
- vendor/
  - Third-party code like vendored gems
- .dockerignore
- .gitattributes
- .gitignore
- .rub-version
- config.ru
  - Rack config for rack-based servers used to start application
- Dockerfile
- Gemfile, Gemfile.lock
  - Specifies gem dependencies used by bundler gem

## Basics
- To start web server, run `rails server`
  - Starts up Puma, a web serber distributed with rails by default
  - To check on browser, go to 'localhost:3000'
- Application classes and modules are available everywhere
  - It's not required to load anything under 'app' with 'require'
  - Loading is required for only files under 'lib' directory

## Command Line
- Create new application
  - rails new temp
  - rails new temp --database=postgresql
- Server
  - rails server
  - rails server -e production
  - rails server -p 4000
- Generate
  - rails generate scaffold User attr1:type1 attr2:type2
    - Model, migration, controller, routes, views
  - rails generate model User attr1:type1 attr2:type2
    - Model, migration
  - rails generate controller Users action1 action2
    - Controller, helper
  - rails generate mailer User
  - rails generate job users_cleanup
- Destroy
  - rails destroy scaffold User
  - rails destroy model User
  - rails destroy controller User
- Routes
  - rails routes
- Console
  - rails console
- Assets
  - rails assets:precompile
  - rails assets:clean
- Tmp
  - rails tmp:clear
  - rails tmp:cache:clear
